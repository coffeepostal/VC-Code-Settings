# Visual Studio Code Settings
These are my [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) settings, most of which are stolen from [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles).

### eslintrc.json
These settings help Lint and Prettifier work nicely together by importing Prettifier through ESLint, instead of two separate plugins.

### UserSettings.json
A backup of my UserSettings.

### vs-code-extensions.md
A list of the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extensions that I'm currently using.

### vscodestyles.css
This CSS file is used by [Custom CSS and JS](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-custom-css) to add some visual flare to the Visual Studio Code interface.
